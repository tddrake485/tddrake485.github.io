    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>I have been working with children and families since 1998, first as a teacher and then as a school social worker. As a teacher, I understand all the factors that can impact learning and be a barrier to success. As a school social worker, I understand how to address these issues, working with teachers and families to support success in school. Now as a therapist in private practice, I understand the importance of providing a safe, non-threatening space for children and young adults to express their feelings in a way that is meaningful and healing for them.</p>
    <p>I have worked with children from age 4 to young adults in high school. My areas of expertise include anxiety, depression, self-esteem/identity, anger, behavioral issues, executive functioning, understanding feelings and emotions, social skills, Autism Spectrum Disorders, ADHD, and other child-related issues and concerns.</p>
    <p>In addition to my work with children and young adults, I have also worked with college students addressing anxiety, depression, ADHD, and other issues that impact their ability to be successful. Many issues that students face as younger children present new challenges as they enter college, and for many students, it is the first time they are attempting to manage these challenges on their own. I am able to provide support to address not only the anxiety and depression, but also study skills.</p>
