- question: What can I expect at my first appointment?
  answer: The first appointment is an assessment and the beginning of the therapeutic relationship. This will be an opportunity for me to get know you and your child and begin to build rapport. The last fifteen minutes will be used to talk with the parents about the therapeutic process and what to expect as sessions continue.

- question: What is play therapy?
  answer: Play therapy is a method of therapy that utilizes play through toys, games, and art. For children, understanding and expressing feelings can be confusing and scary. Play provides a safe, non-threatening way for them to address their issues, while also learning new skills and ways to manage emotions. Using both child-centered play therapy and other directive activities provides them with a variety of ways to understand, express and manage their emotions.

- question: Do you only use play therapy?
  answer: No, I use a variety of approaches based on what works best for the child/client. Although I do believe that play therapy is one of the most successful methods to use with children and this is my primary approach, I also include more directive activities to address specific concerns and issues.

- question: Do you only see children?
  answer: As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, I am trained to work with all ages of clients and address a variety of needs. I currently work with clients from ages 4 through adulthood.

- question: Do you accept insurance?
  answer: I am currently in the process of becoming a provider for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, but I am not able to accept insurance at this time. I will be considered out-of-network for all other providers. I can provide you with a receipt, known as a superbill, that you can submit to your provider for partial reimbursement.

- question: Do you have to give my child a diagnosis?
  answer: Insurance providers require a diagnosis in order for services to be reimbursed. If you choose to use insurance, I must provide a diagnosis. For this reason, many parents will choose to pay out of pocket rather than use insurance. There are some insurance plans that will not cover certain diagnoses, such as those pertaining to adjustments or relationship issues. Insurance companies may also limit the number of sessions a client can use based on of their diagnosis or pay for only certain types of treatment, influencing the overall treatment process without client's best interest in mind.

- question: When and how do I pay you for the session?
  answer: Payment is due at the time of the session. I accept cash, check, credit cards (including HAS cards.) Payment made by credit card will be assessed a $2.00 service fee to cover the cost of transactions. Please see the Financial Policy page for specific information regarding payments.

- question: What are your hours?
  answer: I work Sunday through Thursday by appointment. Weekend and after school hours are the most popular and can be harder to get. If you live near the office and have some flexibility, please consider a before-school appointment for more availability.
