    I am currently in the process of becoming a provider for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, but I am not able to accept insurance at this time. I will be considered out-of-network for all other providers. I can provide you with a receipt, known as a superbill, that you can submit to your provider for partial reimbursement.
