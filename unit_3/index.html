        <h2>Why Play Therapy?</h2>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.a4pt.org">
          &quot;You can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation.&quot; - Plato
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          &quot;Play is the work of childhood.&quot; - Mr. Rogers
        </blockquote>
        <p>It can be scary and confusing to talk about feelings directly. Play provides a safe space and way to communicate and express feelings, as well as learn new ways of relating and solving problems.</p>
